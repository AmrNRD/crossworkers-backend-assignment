MacOS:
- Install VMWare Fusion:
	https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html

- (Optional) Copy the 'backend-test' folder to your local drive for better IO performance.

- Open the 'backend-test/backed-test.vmx' file in VMWare Player/Fusion.
- When prompted, press the 'I copied it' button.

- The VM should now resume a previous state with the test environment running and the project opened in VSCode.
- You should be able to complete your assignment with tools provided in the VM, but feel free to install other tools to your liking.

Good luck :)
